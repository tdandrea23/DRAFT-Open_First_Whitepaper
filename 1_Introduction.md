## Introduction
This whitepaper captures the Government of Canada's (GC) approach to move towards a more open environment in every aspect of our business. While the GC has been operating in an open manner in many respects, this will be our first attempt to bring all of these efforts together in order to more purposefully improve our delivery of services to the public in the most complete and integrated fashion possible. This includes changes in how we work, purchase, and provide information and services. Recognizing that as Canadians and our partners become increasingly digital, so too must our workforce. This whitepaper will outline the various activities that are being done in the relation to becoming more open in an increasingly digital society. 

This direction is coming from the top. In October 2017, the President of the Treasury Board, supported by the Prime Minister, signed a [Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Digital Government with the United Kingdom](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/memorandum-understanding-concerning-digital-government.html). This MOU outlines the need to work together to provide public services in an open manner based on the following [Digital 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5), Principles: User Needs, Open Standards, Open Source Software, Open Markets, Open Government and Assisted Digital. 

Recognizing the GC's use of open source has continued to grow exponentially year after year, there has been little done to update GC policies, governance, funding and processes to ensure that open source tools are being used at the right place at the right time, while ensuring they are supported in a sustainable fashion, and there is appropriate policy and guidance for those using these tools when needed. This whitepaper will help us understand the GC current use of open tools, programs and activities as well as identify current gaps, and outline a path forward to create a more complete open environment. 

### Objectives
This whitepaper is being co-developed by many members of the GC open source community in an effort to get the full-picture of open in the GC. Once we can better understand our use of open tools, programs and activities, we can find new ways to work, build and provide services. While we have made a first attempt at gathering information, including best practices and jurisdictional case studies, there is still a lot more that can be contributed in order to make this document complete. If you have something to add, we would encourage you to contribute your thoughts, expertise and references. 

We want to learn as much as possible from Canadians, our partners, academics and technical experts to help us update GC policies, governance, funding and processes with an open lens.

### GC Digital Principles (DRAFT)
Inspired by of the UK Government, the Government of Ontario and other jurisdictions, the GC is in the process of drafting digital principles that will guide how we work, interact with Canadians, and do business. 

The draft principles are in their final stages of development and will be released through a public consultation. We will share a link here to these principles as soon as they become available.

Three key principles that have guided the writing of this whitepaper are open culture, user needs, and interoperability. As you will see, these concepts permeate all sections of this paper, therefore, we have expanded on this below.  

#### Acting Open
Being self aware of how we do our business is key. Conversations about how to break down silos between departments, our conversations with our partners, academia and the public continue to evolve. The use of open tools, practices, and involvement in open communities will help us to break through these silos and more directly connect people, ideas, tools, information, and services. 

#### User Needs
Gone are the days of designing a program, service, or tool without talking to the person who is going to be using it. Consultations, user experience testing, public opinion research are all important aspects of how we are starting to do business, and will do business in the future. Once we understand the needs of our users, we can build a service that helps them do the thing they want to do at the first attempt without having to understand government and is built on your usersâ€™ real needs, not our assumptions.  

#### Interoperability
The actors involved in digital interactions have not only increased exponentially in number but have also become more diverse: individuals, users, businesses, the public, institutions and things all communicate via computer exchanges. These computer exchanges have become an essential conduit, and their overall heterogeneity is an even greater reason for interoperability, meaning the ability to make a variety of information systems communicate with one another. Since this report discusses digital interactions, the expressions "interoperability of information systems (IS)" and "interoperability of information technologies (IT) or information and communication technologies (ICT)" are synonymous.

For any organization, especially a government agency, this need for interoperability is at two distinct yet partially overlapping levels: internal interoperability with its own information and communication technologies (ICTs), and interoperability with the ICTs of external stakeholders (other administrations, the public, businesses, associations), whether directly or indirectly, through the availability of open data or networks of linked, open data.

A lack of interoperability can lead, at best, to a breakdown in communication or operations and, at worst, to an outright loss of access to its information.
